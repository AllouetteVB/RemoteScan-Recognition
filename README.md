## Description
The primary objective of this project is to establish a document signing mechanism centered around gesture recognition. Essentially, users would have the ability to sign documents by gesturing their signature in the air with their hand. To realize this, we aim to leverage a computer setup comprising an image analysis program running concurrently with its webcam. This setup will allow for real-time tracking and interpretation of hand movements to accurately capture and reproduce signatures digitally.
