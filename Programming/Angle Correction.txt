The objects are projected on a perpendicular plane to the camera. But it could be at an angle. As such the plane would also have an angle. 

The users, when drawing on the air, might not be drawing relative to that plane, it would result in the drawing being oriented.

We then need to correct that orientation and replace it to the plane.

For that task, there is multiple problematics :
	- Defining what the angle of the camera is
	- Defining what the angle of the drawing is (relative to the camera)
	- Apply transformation to the drawing to replace it

There is the need to do research for that question.

The first point might be resolved later as it would be really hard to define from the camera's point of view.
